\section{Description}
    In this assignment, we must transform a real-world problem into a maximum flow problem.

    There is $m$ students, and $n$ projects. Each project has a capacity, called $C$. A student can take a project only if he has the qualifications for. In short, each student can go into a subset of the projects.


\section{Solution}
    \begin{figure}

        \caption{An example of the problem transformed to a flow graph. $m=3$ and $n=4$.}
        \label{fig:graph}
    \end{figure}

    In the Figure \ref{fig:graph}, we can clearly see different column. Each one a a specific purpose, to allow us to recreate the problem.

    The first column "set" the number of students. It prevent us to have more than $m$ students in the solution. It sort of create the students.

    The second column specify the allowed projects for each student. Therefore, a student can go only in the project where he is allowed to. It create a waiting room for each project.

    The third column "empty" the waiting room, and fill the projects. 

    The last one is used to finish the graph.
